/*
 * Ordered_list is a linked-list class template  with iterators similar to the
 * Standard Library std::list class.  The iterators encapsulate a pointer to
 * the list nodes, and are a public class nested within the Ordered_list class,
 * and would be declared e.g. as Ordered_list<int>::Iterator; Operators ++, *,
 * and -> are overloaded for iterators similar to std::list<>::iterator.
 * Copy constructor and assignment operators are defined, so that Ordered_lists
 * can be used like built-in types.
 *
 * This is an ordered list in that the nodes are automatically kept in order.
 * The ordering function is a constructor parameter.  It takes two objects as
 * arguments and returns true if the first should come before the second in
 * order, and false otherwise.  The ordering function is an optional
 * constructor parameter; if none is supplied, the default is to use the
 * defined less_than function template which uses the < operator for the type,
 * which orders the list from smallest to largest. The only way to add to the
 * list is with the insert function, which automatically puts the new item in
 * the proper place in the list.
 *
 * The ordering function arguments are of type reference-to-const, meaning that
 * the ordering function neither copies nor modifies the objects in the list.
 * This produces improved performance with complex types, but is of course
 * unnecessarily convoluted for simple types like pointers and integers.
 *
 * The easiest way to declare an ordering function with simple types is with a
 * typedef for the simple type, followed by a function declaration using the
 * typedef declared as reference-to-const, as in:
 *
 *   typedef Record * Record_ptr_t;
 *   bool order_Records_by_title(const Record_ptr_t& rp1,
 *                               const Record_ptr_t& rp2);
 *
 * To find an object in the list that matches a supplied "probe" object, the
 * ordering function is used to to determine equality. That is, the find
 * functions assume that if both (x < y) and (y < x) are false, then x == y.
 * This allows both insert and find operations to be done with only the
 * less-than relation.
 *
 * When an object is inserted in the list, a copy is made and assigned into the
 * list node, so objects stored in the list must have accessible and properly
 * defined copy constructors and assignment operators.
 *
 * When a node is removed from the list with erase(), it is destroyed, and so
 * the object contained in the node must have an accessible and properly
 * defined destructor function.  When the list is cleared with the clear()
 * function, or destroyed, all of the list nodes are destroyed.
 *
 * This class does not attempt to protect the list items from being modified.
 * If a list item is modified in a way that changes where it should appear in
 * the list, the list will become disordered and list items may become
 * un-findable or new items will be inserted incorrectly - the effects are
 * undefined, although a specific implementation might behave in a predictable
 * manner.
 *
 * It is user's responsibility to ensure that items are not changed in a way
 * that affects the validity of the ordering in the list.
 *
 * If the user declares a list of pointers to objects, the user is responsible
 * for allocating and deallocating the pointed-to objects. Note especially that
 * if the Ordered_list is deallocated or cleared, or a single node is erased
 * from the list, the pointed-to data is NOT deallocated. In short, the
 * Ordered_list does not attempt to manage the user's objects.
 *
 * If any operations are attempted that are erroneous (e.g. erasing a
 * non-existent node), the results are undefined.
